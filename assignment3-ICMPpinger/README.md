#Socket Programming Assignment 5: ICMP Pinger
=========================================================================
In this lab, you will gain a better understanding of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). You will learn to implement a Ping application using ICMP request and reply messages.

Ping is a computer network application used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network. It is also used to self-test the network interface card of the computer or as a latency test. It works by sending ICMP “echo reply” packets to the target host and listening for ICMP “echo reply” replies. The "echo reply" is sometimes called a pong. Ping measures the round-trip time, records packet loss, and prints a statistical summary of the echo reply packets received (the minimum, maximum, and the mean of the round-trip times and in some versions the standard deviation of the mean).
